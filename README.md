# SteamStat
A personal Steam statistics website built with Valve's web API.

## About
This website was built as a semester project for my Computer Science course "Web Development and Programming 2."
It is designed to be a personal, informational website about my personal video gaming habits. It gathers data from Steam's API about the games that I've played recently and other games that I own in my library!
Please feel free to play around with it, as this was such a fun project for me to develop! If you have any thoughts or comments, I'd love to receive your feedback at my email.

## Goals
Emphasize accessibility, usability, and responsive development. Learn a popular, modern web development framework and apply it.

## Stack
Bootstrap Framework, WAMP (Windows, Apache Server, MySQL, PHP) with a touch of JavaScript.
